2022,Spring,2022-sp,ATMS,304,Radiative Transfer-Remote Sens,"Introduction to the laws governing the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. Topics include absorption, emission, and scattering of radiation, absorption and scattering properties of atmospheric constituents, the Sun as a source of radiation, the radiative transfer equation, and simple radiative balance models. Emphasis will be placed on the role of radiation in weather and climate, the description of atmospheric optical phenomena, and the application to remote sensing.
