2022,Spring,2022-sp,MACS,301,Cinema Decades,"Surveys the trends and tendencies within the context of cinema of a particular decade, as well as the industry or industries from which it emerged. Rather than move chronologically through the decade, this course will approach the decade through an exploration of the significant movements within the industry and counter-movements that occurred in response. We will look at how significant artists navigated the mainstream studios and distribution companies and will also look at niche-specific independent filmmakers and the movements of the era. This class will allow students the opportunity to challenge preconceived notions of the decade's cinema. It will also encourage students to synthesize their analyses of this decade's films with information regarding the shifting nature of the film industry.",3 hours.,,,,71956,A,A,B,Cinema Decades: The 80's,,A,Closed,Lecture-Discussion,LCD,03:00 PM,05:50 PM,TR,205,Gregory Hall,"Turnock, J"
