Emphasis will be placed on problem-solving and scientific methods. Credit is not given for ASTR 121 if credit in either ASTR 100 or ASTR 210 has been earned. Students with credit in PHYS 211 are encouraged to take ASTR 210.",3 hours.,Credit is not given for ASTR 121 if credit in either ASTR 100 or ASTR 210 has been earned. Students with credit in PHYS 211 are encouraged to take ASTR 210.,"Nat Sci & Tech - Phys Sciences, and Quantitative Reasoning II course.","ASTR 121 and ASTR 122 cover the same topics as ASTR 100, but the material and topics are covered in much more depth over two semesters instead of one. ASTR 121 and ASTR 122 are independent offerings and can be taken in any order. While ASTR 121 and ASTR 122 are for non-science majors, problem solving with basic algebra is required. Science and astronomy majors should take ASTR 210. Students must register for one discussion and one lecture section.",30832,AL1,A,1,,,A,Open,Lecture,LEC,01:00 PM,01:50 PM,TR,100,Materials Science & Eng Bld,"Winans, A"
