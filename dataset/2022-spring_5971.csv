2022,Spring,2022-sp,IB,494,Theoretical Biology + Models,"Biologists are increasingly using mathematical and computer-based models to complement fieldwork and experimental data. These models provide a context in which to understand and answer existing questions, and also lead us to new questions and new insights. Students will encode biological mechanisms into mathematical models, develop the skills to find solutions to these models and relate them to biological data, and analyze and discuss relevant primary literature. Examples will be drawn largely from ecology and evolutionary biology. 4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
