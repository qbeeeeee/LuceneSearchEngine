2022,Spring,2022-sp,AE,484,"UAV Performance, Design, and Fabrication","This course will cover topics necessary to design, fabricate, and evaluate the performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). After a brief introduction to UAVs, an overview will be given of aerodynamics, stability/control, propulsion, aircraft performance, UAV hardware, manufacturing methods, and computational tools needed to fabricate unmanned aerial vehicles. An emphasis of the course will be on aircraft fabrication techniques (welding, composites, turning, milling, joining, additive manufacturing, etc.) culminating in the construction of the final design project. 3 undergraduate hours.
