2022,Spring,2022-sp,ACE,532,Spatial Econometrics,"This course provides the statistical and econometric techniques required for spatial analysis and appropriate modeling of cross-sectional (and panel) datasets. While spatial statistics allow the students to identify the two spatial effects commonly found in geocoded samples (spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity), spatial econometrics is especially geared towards including these effects in a regression model. An important aspect of the course is to gain hands-on experience in applying the appropriate techniques and using state-of-the-art software (such as the spatial econometric toolboxes available in R). 4 graduate hours.
