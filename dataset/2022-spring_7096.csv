2022,Spring,2022-sp,LING,304,Elements of Morphology,"An introduction to the concepts and methods of morphology, the linguistic study of word formation. We examine the smallest units of word structure--how they are arranged and organized, and how they interact with sentence structures (syntax) and sound patterns (phonology). Students will consider data from many different languages, and investigate how those languages are similar and different in terms of how they form their words.
