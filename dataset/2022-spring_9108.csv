2022,Spring,2022-sp,NPRE,561,Advanced Risk Analysis for Technological Systems,"This course covers advanced modeling techniques for Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), which provides input for risk-informed decision-making in design, operation, and regulatory oversight of complex technological systems such as nuclear power, space, chemical processes, oil and gas. Main topics: risk scenario modeling, common cause failure analysis, Bayesian updating, uncertainty analysis, Bayesian Belief Network, simulation-based PRA, probabilistic physics of failure, human reliability analysis, and expert elicitation & aggregation. PRA and Bayesian analysis software codes are utilized for assignments. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: NPRE 461 or NPRE 457 or GE 411 or CEE 491.",4 hours.,4 graduate hours.
