2022,Spring,2022-sp,MBA,545,Marketing in Our New Digital World,"Offers a strategic perspective and examination on how the digital revolution is changing the marketing landscape. We will explore this new digital realm and discuss its revolutionary impact upon both firms and consumers. This exploration comes in two parts. In the first part (the first four weeks), we will explore how the digital revolution has affected our analog (or physical) world. Specifically, we will examine four ways in which the Analog World has been affected by the Digital Revolution: Domination, Resistance, Synergy, and Transformation. In the second part (the second four weeks), we will review the foundations of marketing (i.e., product, promotion, placement, and price) and examine how these foundations are being shifted by the rise of the digital revolution. In this portion of the course, we will explore a variety of new digital concepts and tools, including, customer co-creation, user-generated content, and 3D printing. This course will contain several examples of each of these concepts and explore their implications for both marketers and consumers. This course will also employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, hands-on exercises, and interviews with leading marketing scholars. The learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and be a member of a rich learning community. I hope you will join us in this educational adventure. Please note that this is not an e-commerce class. We will not examine social media analytics, search engine optimization, or other digital marketing tactics. The other courses in our Digital Marketing Specialization will cover these topics in considerable detail. Instead, this course is broader in focus and more strategic in orientation. 4 graduate hours.
