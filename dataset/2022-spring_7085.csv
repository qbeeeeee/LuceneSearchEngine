2022,Spring,2022-sp,LING,270,"Language, Technology &amp; Society","What technologies have humans developed to augment the quintessential human ability: language? We start with the development of writing, the first technology that was specifically designed for language, and trace its history through the invention of printing, and into the digital age.
