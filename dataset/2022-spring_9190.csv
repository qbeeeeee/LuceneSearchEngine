2022,Spring,2022-sp,NRES,490,Surface Water System Chemistry,"Examines the interaction of chemical and biological processes that govern the chemistry of streams, lakes, and wetlands, and the response of aquatic organisms to pollution. Chemical equilibrium and kinetic principles are used to analyze the behavior of surface water systems through the use of models. Topics include modeling of field studies in environmental inorganic chemistry and biogeochemistry. The laboratory section will be devoted to instruction in the use of computer models and to their practical application. 4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
