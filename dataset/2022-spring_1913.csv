2022,Spring,2022-sp,CHBE,476,Biotransport,"Investigates the critical roles the transports of mass, energy and momentum play in the function of living systems at varied levels (e.g., cells , tissues, and organs) and time scales. Transport phenomena are also central to the design and operation of devices for biological research, imaging, biochemical processes, and therapeutic interventions including drug delivery, gene therapy and tissue engineering. Students will explore conservation laws of mass, energy, and momentum to mathematically describe cell and molecular biology, immunology, physiology and biomedical engineering systems. 3 undergraduate hours.
