Students will learn open source mapping and visualization libraries such as Leaflet, D3 and Plotly and how to mash up these libraries to create interactive and dynamic visualization tools and GIS applications. Students are expected to learn how to visualize not only geospatial data but also results of spatial analysis. Emphasis is placed on learning the cutting-edge advances of geospatial visualization and visual analytics and practical skills to create geospatial applications based on such advances. 4 graduate hours.
