2022,Spring,2022-sp,GEOL,450,Investigating the Earth’s Interior,"Overview of how seismology, magnetics, gravity, geodesy, and surface geology can help us understand the Earth from its surface to its core as well as its temporal evolution. Topics include the internal composition and dynamics of Earth, generation of Earth's gravitational and geomagnetic fields, driving mechanisms for tectonic plate motion, continental deformation, and surface topography. Students wanting a more quantitative treatment of geophysics should enroll in GEOL 452. 3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours. Credit is not given for both GEOL 450 and GEOL 452. Prerequisite: PHYS 102 or 212, GEOL 107 or 101, or consent of instructor.",3 hours.,"3 undergraduate hours. 3 graduate hours. Credit is not given for both GEOL 450 and GEOL 452.
