2022,Spring,2022-sp,CPSC,554,Quantitative Genetics and Genomics,"Most important traits in plant species are quantitative, which means that they are affected by large numbers of genes and their interaction with the environment. Many techniques and tools have developed to try to accelerate quantitative trait improvement, however understanding these methods and how to apply them appropriately remains a significant challenge for breeders and breeding organizations. Through this course, students will gain knowledge on fundamental quantitative genetics concepts and learn how to apply this knowledge to everyday plant breeding situations. Special attention will be given to the application of QTL discovery, population improvement, and genomic selection in plant breeding programs. Each class will consist of a combination of lecture and in-class computer exercises conducted in small groups that the instructor will coach individually. Weekly readings from textbooks and/or primary sources will be assigned to help deepen student’s understanding of the topics covered in class. 3 graduate hours. No professional credit.
