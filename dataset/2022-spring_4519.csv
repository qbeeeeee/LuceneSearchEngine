2022,Spring,2022-sp,ENGL,441,Innovation and Conflict in British and Irish Modernism,"This course will examine British and Irish modernism, one of the most dynamic, provocative, and experimental periods in literary history. The early decades of the twentieth century witnessed the rapid introduction of new technologies, the upheaval of global politics, the radical transformation of gender roles, and the traumatic fallout from two world wars. The period's literature and art processed these turbulent cultural experiences through extreme formal experimentation, and this course will consider many of the key works emerging from the modernist and avant-garde movements. Among the authors we'll study are Joseph Conrad, W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, Charlie Chaplin, and Samuel Beckett. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
