2022,Spring,2022-sp,ECE,484,Principles of Safe Autonomy,"Introduces techniques for building autonomous systems such as autonomous cars, delivery drones, and manufacturing robots, and techniques for performing their safety analysis. Covers key algorithms and approaches in perception, modeling, motion planning, control, and safety analysis, with a view towards understanding their basic assumptions and performance guarantees. Also provides exposure to some of the state-of-the-art software tools for control, simulation, and analysis. Students will get experience through labs, programming assignments, and they will perform hands-on laboratory work on the Polaris GEM autonomous vehicle platform. Course material is distilled from recent research papers; thus, there is no required textbook. 4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: CS 124, ECE 220 or equivalent; ECE313, IE300, or STAT400. A course on data structures, algorithms, differential equations, and linear algebra is recommended.",4 hours.,"4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
