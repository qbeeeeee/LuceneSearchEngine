2022,Spring,2022-sp,STAT,556,Advanced Time Series Analysis,"This is a graduate-level course on time series analysis, with an emphasis on nonlinear and multivariate time series. Topics include: linear time series, nonlinear time series, continuous-time models, multivariate and high-dimensional models. Students will learn how to build adequate models, perform statistical estimation and inference, conduct prediction, and related topics. Students will also learn some basic mathematical tools (such as Markov chains, martingales, stochastic calculus, concentration inequalities, etc.) for theoretically analyzing large-sample properties of general nonlinear random processes. 4 graduate hours.
