2022,Spring,2022-sp,FIN,555,Financial Innovation,"Recent years have seen the rapid development of the fintech sector, bringing together technology and data, startups and established firms in ways that are likely to shape and disrupt financial markets going forward. This course will involve a mix of lectures, guest speakers, and class discussion of breaking developments and new ventures. Some of the fintech sectors we will discuss include consumer finance, payments, investing and trading, cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and privacy and regulatory concerns. Because of the innovative and rapidly evolving nature of the fintech sector, this class will depend heavily on student engagement and class discussion. Students should be prepared to participate actively, and not just sit and listen to lectures. Each student will participate in two group presentations on the fintech sector, at the middle and end of the semester. A group project is due at the end of the semester, detailing a fintech startup idea, an analysis of an existing fintech business, or an analysis of a fintech sector. 4 graduate hours.
