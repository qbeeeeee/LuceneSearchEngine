2022,Spring,2022-sp,GEOL,552,Geodynamics,"Explores dynamic characteristics of the solid earth. Covers physical and mathematical theories of deformation occurring on the surface and within the lithosphere and mantle. Discusses observations that can help us understand past and ongoing earth dynamics; these observation include topography, gravity, heat flow, geology, mineral physics, and seismic and magnetotelluric images, as well as plate tectonics theory. Includes regular lectures and tutorials on geodynamic modeling.
