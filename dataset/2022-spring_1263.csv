2022,Spring,2022-sp,ASTR,510,Computational Astrophysics,"Prepares students to use numerical simulations to study complex problems in astrophysics and cosmology. Numerical methods and parallel computing will be covered together with the design, validation, and analysis of simulations. Emphasis is placed on solving ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in astrophysical contexts. Students work on assigned numerical problems and perform simulations using existing simulation codes, writing a final paper which presents the results of simulations using one of these codes. There are no formal prerequisites except knowledge of a scientific programming language such as Fortran, C, and C++. Familiarity with Unix/Linux and astronomical analysis tools is useful but not required.",4 hours.,,,,57084,CA,A,1,,,A,Open,Lecture,LEC,02:00 PM,03:20 PM,MW,134,Astronomy Building,"Ricker, P"
