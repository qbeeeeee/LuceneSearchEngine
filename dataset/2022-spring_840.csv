2022,Spring,2022-sp,ANTH,450,Zooarchaeology,"Zooarchaeology is the study of the many ways that animals fit into past human societies—including diet, economy, and ideology—through the analysis of animal remains (bones, teeth, and shell) recovered from archaeological sites. Given the broad range of ways that animals were involved in past human life, and the ubiquity of faunal remains in the archaeological record, faunal analysis is a method suitable for addressing many kinds of archaeological and anthropological research questions. This course will provide students with a practical working knowledge of basic laboratory identification and quantification techniques, and provide a framework for the interpretation of archaeological faunal assemblages. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
