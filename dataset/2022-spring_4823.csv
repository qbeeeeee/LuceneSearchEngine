2022,Spring,2022-sp,EPSY,579,Structural Equation Modeling,Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a general class of multivariate techniques that models relationships between latent variables and observed variables (“measurement models”) and relationships among latent variables (“structural models”) simultaneously. Students will learn the theoretical background of SEM as well as the techniques using programming language R. Topics covered in this class include mediation/moderation model; confirmatory factor analysis; model fit evaluation; multi-group SEM; latent growth modeling; MTMM model; and SEM with categorical variables. 4 graduate hours.
