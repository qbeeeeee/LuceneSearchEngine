2022,Spring,2022-sp,GEOL,572,Hydrogeology with Python,"Hydrogeologic concepts and real-world datasets are explored using the coding language Python and associated packages (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, FloPy). Data will be imported from a variety of sources, then analyzed to develop scientific models, and finally visualized. There will be hands-on experience with: 1) evaluating well tests to determine aquifer properties, 2) developing geologic and potentiometric surfaces from observed data, and 3) understanding implications of boundary conditions (surface waters, faults) on regional groundwater flow. 4 graduate hours.
