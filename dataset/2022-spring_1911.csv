2022,Spring,2022-sp,CHBE,458,Synthetic Nanomaterials,"Study of the concepts related to the fundamentals and practical methods for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Classical nucleation and growth, interfacial science, crystal structures, and characterization techniques are among some of the topics covered. The emphasis will be placed on the processing controls of size, shape (dot, wire, and two-dimensional materials), facet, composition, and hierarchical structure. Students will also be exposed to related current topics, including the applications of nanoparticles in energy, sustainability, and biotechnology. 3 undergraduate hours. No graduate credit.
