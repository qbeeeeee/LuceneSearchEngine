2022,Spring,2022-sp,AE,550,Nonlinear Aeroelasticity,"Integrated fundamental treatment of the physical and mathematical aspects of nonlinear aeroelasticity. Fluid-solid interactions of unsteady aerodynamics and flexible structures and their components with applications to air-space-land vehicles, wind mills, solar sails, and gossamer structures. Physical and mathematical modeling; solution protocols to nonlinear problems; self-excited nonlinear oscillators; torsional divergence, loss of stability and control due to structural flexibility; chordwise and un-symmetric bending; viscous and structural damping, motion control; straight and swept-wind flutter; stall divergence and flutter; panel flutter; aerodynamic noise; chaotic motion; gust loads; limit cycles.
