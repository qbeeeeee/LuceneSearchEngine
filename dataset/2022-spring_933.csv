2022,Spring,2022-sp,ARCH,435,Structural Systems and Construction Methods,"Presents a unified approach to architectural structures and construction technology to enable students to integrate design, engineering, and construction, while providing an understanding of how material/component/system decisions impact the work of architects, engineers, and constructors. Using a series of case-studies and project-based assignments, students learn about the various structural systems and construction methods used in the design of buildings. The evolution and state-of-the-art in structure and construction strategies will be discussed to provide requisite breadth and depth. Topics covered include: structural and building codes; structural systems and their layout planning; foundation systems; construction methods and technologies in wood, steel, concrete, and masonry; sustainability considerations; detailing; and digital modeling. 4 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
