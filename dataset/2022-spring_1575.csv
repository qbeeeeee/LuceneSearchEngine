2022,Spring,2022-sp,BIOE,575,Capstone Project,"Students in the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Bioengineering program will demonstrate their proficiency through a capstone project, where students will work on a translational project to develop solutions for real world problems utilizing principles of design, engineering analysis, and functional operation of engineering systems. Depending on the student's flexibility and availability, capstone projects may include collaboration with other online M.Eng. students on a team-based project, analysis of case studies, or even a self-directed project that directly relates to a specific area of interest or on behalf of their employer. Project presentations and demonstrations may be required at the end of the program. 3 graduate hours. No professional credit. May be repeated for 6 hours in separate semesters. Students in the Master of Engineering program will be required to sign up for BIOE 575 in both the Fall and Spring semesters.
