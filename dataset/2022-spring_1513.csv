In fact, some claim that artificial intelligence alone will displace millions of jobs; while others claim that this same technology will also create even more jobs. In this course we explore how to peer through the fog of disruption in order to make informed strategic decisions. Specifically, in this course you will learn about strategic framing to understand the global landscape, we will discuss probability and risk to quantify the opportunities and challenges, and we will examine different technologies at a high-level and discuss how they may impact, positively and negatively, both society and business.
