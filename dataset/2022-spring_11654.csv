2022,Spring,2022-sp,UP,230,Transportation Planning: Fundamentals and Innovations,"Introduces fundamental concepts and emerging shifts/innovations in the field of transportation planning. The course will prepare students to address the following questions: What does our transportation system look like today, and how did we get here? How do people make decisions about travel? What are the impacts of these decisions on the environment, the economy, social equity, congestion, public health, and safety? Will autonomous vehicles simply encourage more driving, or can they be harnessed in a way that supports wider community goals? How do we design streets that are safe for all travel modes? Through a combination of discussions, case studies, and hands-on activities, students will think critically and creatively about these questions and about the role of transportation planners in creating positive change for communities.
