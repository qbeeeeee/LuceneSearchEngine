2022,Spring,2022-sp,LING,446,Fundamentals for Speech Signal Processing and Analysis,"Provides an elementary introduction to concepts, principles and algorithms of digital signal processing. It focuses on computational implementations of contemporary methodologies in digital signal processing rather than underlying mathematical theories, and therefore requires students to have basic Python or MATLAB programming skills as prerequisite. This course comprises lectures and laboratory sessions, during which students are expected to produce their own computer code aided by ready-made programs to solve practical problems. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
