2022,Spring,2022-sp,ABE,452,Engineering for Disaster Resilience,"A project-based experience designed to engage students in development of resilient food, energy, and water supply chains designs for disaster-prone regions. Students will investigate background factors that provide context for specific disaster-prone regions and viable design solutions. Students will quantify expected engineering reliability to potential solutions. Students will work with local communities, aid organizations, and peer institutions when identifying resilient designs, eventually seeking pathways to implement solutions with partner communities. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
