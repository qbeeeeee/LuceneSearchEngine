2022,Spring,2022-sp,CEE,556,Hydrocomplexity,"Application of complex system science to water cycle and related processes in the atmosphere, ecosystems, critical zone and human systems. The course covers analytical and data driven approaches for characterization and understanding of non-linear systems, feedbacks and causality, chaos and fractals, complex network science, and emergent behavior. The course emphasizes emerging research frontiers along with traditional foundations through analytical understanding of non-linear dynamical systems, and their identification and characterization from observations. 4 graduate hours.
