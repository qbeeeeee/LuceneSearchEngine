The course is divided into three large subject areas each lasting approximately five weeks: (1) sound, sound fields, and digital recording, (2) digital technology in composition and performance, and (3) psychoacoutics and digitized music analysis. Within each subject area, students are first introduced to relevant acoustic and musical principles, then learn about their implementation in the digital domain, and lastly gain practical experience with the subject matter through hands-on projects involving the capture, creation, editing and analysis of musical sound using standard hardware and computer applications.
