2022,Spring,2022-sp,ECE,410,Neural Circuits and Systems,"Introduction to modeling functions of neurons and systems of neurons in the brain. Topics include Boolean signal processing, nonlinear diffusion equations, delay-and-add synaptic signal processing. Integrates information from the structure and physiology from a single neuron up to the assembly of brain circuits. Examples presented to discuss neural circuit and systems include the auditory, and to a lesser extent, visual system. Course concludes with a look at theories of brain function built up from systems of neurons. Same as NE 410. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours. Prerequisite: MATH 285 or equivalent.
