2022,Spring,2022-sp,PS,394,Crisis Diplomacy,"A comparative study of foreign policy decision-making and diplomacy among the major states from 1816-1948 with a focus on crisis bargaining, management, and escalation. Foreign relations of Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Japan, and the United States are covered in light of international relations theories. Emphasis is placed on how domestic political struggles, like those between hard liners and accommodationists, and external factors, like alliances and international norms, affect decision-making. Comparisons are made between those crises that are peacefully settled and those that escalate to war and/or get out of control.
