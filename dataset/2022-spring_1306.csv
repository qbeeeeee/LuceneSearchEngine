2022,Spring,2022-sp,ATMS,526,Risk Analysis in the Geosciences,"This course will introduce concepts and methods in quantitative risk analysis in the Earth, atmospheric, and environmental sciences. Key concepts will include probability, impacts, risk, uncertainty, statistical estimation, and decision making. Students will use simple risk analysis methods to apply these concepts to example problems related to drought, flooding, weather extremes, and anthropogenic climate change. The students will learn the R programming language for statistical computing, which will be used to integrate concepts and methods using observational data and model output, and we will focus on real-world multi-disciplinary applications. 4 graduate hours.
