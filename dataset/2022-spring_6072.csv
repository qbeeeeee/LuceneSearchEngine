2022,Spring,2022-sp,INFO,418,Makerspace: Escape Rooms,"Explores the intersection of storytelling, interaction design, and user experience through the design of escape rooms. In the past few years escape rooms have been on the rise, changing from simple locked boxes in an open room to complex adventures spanning multiple rooms involving electronics, sound design, storytelling, and even live actors. This class will be primarily focusing on the manufacturing and electronics work that goes into making an immersive but self-contained escape room in a box experience. Over the span of the course, students will become familiar with the basics of several advanced small-scale manufacturing tools, such as laser engravers, electronic cutters, and 3D printers/scanners. The primary focus, however, will be a more in depth exploration of small board electronics – such as Arduino and IoT programming – and hardware – such as sensors, servos, LEDs, and other components. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
