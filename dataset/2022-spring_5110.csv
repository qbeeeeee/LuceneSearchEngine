2022,Spring,2022-sp,FIN,543,Legal Issues in Real Estate,"This course examines the fundamentals of real estate from a legal perspective. Students develop skills in using legal concepts in a real estate transactional setting that incorporates traditional course materials, case studies, real life transactions, and guest lectures designed to provide a practical ""hands-on"" approach to real estate law. We explore a broad range of current sophisticated real estate transactions relating to residential and commercial purchases, sales, leasehold interests, common interest communities, ownership, financing, brokerage, land use and development. We discuss the legal implications that contractual private and legislative public restrictions have on individuals' real property rights and discuss public policy arguments related to private owners’ legal rights. 4 graduate hours.
