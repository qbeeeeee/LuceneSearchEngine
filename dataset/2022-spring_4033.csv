2022,Spring,2022-sp,ECE,554,Dynamic System Reliability,"Reliability and dynamic performance evaluation for large-scale and complex systems; building on system-theoretic modeling, analysis, and design techniques. Design methods for reliability including architecture design and filter-based fault detection and isolation. Analytical methods for optimal redundancy allocation, sensitivity analysis methods for iterative system design, and other techniques for design optimization. Mechatronic systems used in aircraft and automotive, power electronic systems, and electrical power systems are examples of applications discussed. Same as ME 544.
