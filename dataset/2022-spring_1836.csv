2022,Spring,2022-sp,CEE,554,Hydrologic Variability,"Advanced quantitative treatment of catchment hydrology, focusing on analysis of observed hydrologic and hydroclimatic variability, and their interpretation in terms of the underlying processes. Concepts of heterogeneity and variability, scale and scaling, process change and process interactions will be emphasized. Theoretical foundations of hydrologic applications, such as flood estimation, water balance analyses, hydrologic modeling and associated scale problems will be discussed in sufficient detail to prepare students to undertake advanced research and professional practice.
