2022,Spring,2022-sp,IB,439,Biogeography,"Spatial and temporal patterns of biological diversity and the factors that govern the distribution and abundance of taxa. This course addresses two of its subfields: historical biogeography - the origin, dispersal, and extinction of taxa and biotas; and ecological biogeography - the role physical and biotic environments have played in determining taxonomic distributions. Also explores the ecological, evolutionary, climatological, and paleontological foundations for the distribution of species and biological communities. Includes a review of many of the field's classical papers, the current synthesis of biogeographic theory, and the relevance of biogeography to modern conservation goals. Offered in alternate years.
