2022,Spring,2022-sp,CEE,490,Computer Methods,"Computer methods and their programming for solving common types of differential equations arising in civil and environmental engineering (hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic equations, with emphasis on prototypical cases, such as the convection-diffusion equation, as well as Laplace’s / Poisson’s equation). Exposure to state-of-the-art open-source numerical methods libraries. The course enables students in civil and environmental engineering to develop high-performance and high-purpose codes in these open-source frameworks for their research problems in an efficient way. 3 undergraduate hours. 4 graduate hours.
