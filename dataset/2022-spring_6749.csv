2022,Spring,2022-sp,LAW,305,Art and Cultural Property Law,"This course concerns the emergence of ""art"" and ""cultural property"" law as a distinct field of legal inquiry and practice. Still, this subject draws from nearly the entire spectrum of traditional legal subjects – intellectual property, free speech, contracts, crime, treaties, tax, etc. Art and Cultural Property Law deals with the relationships, rights, transactions and disputes among collectors, artists (and their heirs), dealers, auction houses, museums and other art world participants (including local and foreign governments, sovereign nations and indigenous peoples, the entertainment industry, sports franchises and social media). Among the dozens of important relevant issues in this field are the successes and failures of law in policing cultural heritage crimes, the rise of artistic nationalism, cultural heritage as a casualty of war, censorship, and provenance studies.
